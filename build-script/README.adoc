== Goals

Provide a uniform build, test and release workflow, both locally and within the gitlab platform
which allows customization where needed.

== Installing

=== Automated
Install the build script in your git repo with the following, `curl pipe bash`, command:

[source,sh]
----
curl -s -L https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/build-script/raw/reprolang/init_repo.sh | bash
----

=== Manual initialization

In the following sub-sections you'll find a breakdown of the commands run by the script.

==== Initialize git local repo with https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/build-script[build-script] as submodule

[source,sh]
----
VERSION=reprolang-1.0.0 && \
git init && \
git submodule add https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/build-script.git build-script && \
cd build-script && \
git checkout ${VERSION} && \
cd .. && \
ln -s build-script/build.sh build.sh && \
ln -s build-script/copy_data_noop.sh copy_data.sh && \
ln -s build-script/update_version_noop.sh update_version.sh && \
cp build-script/_gitlab-ci_default.yml .gitlab-ci.yml
----

In order to update with changes from the submodule remote, issue the following command from the repository root:
[source,sh]
----
git submodule update --recursive --remote
----

==== Prepare the directory structure

[source.sh]
----
mkdir -p image input output/tables_and_plots output/datasets/
touch image/.gitkeep
touch input/.gitkeep
touch output/tables_and_plots/.gitkeep
touch output/datasets/.gitkeep
echo 'input/*' >> .gitignore
echo 'output/tables_and_plots/*' >> .gitignore
echo 'output/datasets/*' >> .gitignore
----

==== Update local git repo

[source,sh]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Intialized empty repo with build script v${VERSION}"
----

=== Output

Running the automated `curl pipe bash` command or doing it manually should result in a directory structure similar to
the following (hidden files not shown):

[source, sh]
----
.
├── build-script
│   ├── LICENSE.txt
│   ├── README.adoc
│   ├── build.sh
│   └── copy_data_noop.sh
├── build.sh -> build-script/build.sh
├── copy_data.sh -> build-script/copy_data_noop.sh
├── image
├── input
└── output
    ├── datasets 
    └── tables_and_plots 

3 directories, 6 files
----

After adding files to the `image` directories, the `.gitkeep` files can be removed. However it does no harm
to leave them be.

== Upgrading

From the parent project root directory, run:

[source,sh]
----
git submodule update --recursive --remote
----


== Customizing

=== Build parameters

You can provide custom values for some of the parameters used in the build process by placing a `variables.sh` file in
the root of your repository.

Possible values:
[source,sh]
----
IMAGE_DIR="your new image directory/"           #Make sure this ends with a "/"
----

=== Testing

In order to test your dockerized environment a `docker-compose.yml` file should be created in the `test` subdirectory.
Within this compose file the services to test together with a test suite should be defined and after running all tests all
containers should exit succsfully (exit code 0) for the test to pass.

Example for nginx:
[source,sh]
----
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    image: "${IMAGE_QUALIFIED_NAME}"
    command: --test
    volumes:
      - test:/test
      - ./default.conf:/nginx_conf.d/default.conf:ro
  nginx-test:
    image: "registry.gitlab.com/clarin-eric/docker-tester:1.2.0"
    command: http multi -v -k
    volumes:
      - ./checker.conf:/etc/checker.conf
      - test:/test
volumes:
  test:
    external: false
----

Note that:

- the `${IMAGE_QUALIFIED_NAME}` variable is set within the build script to reference the latest version of your image.
- by using `command: --test` the services knows to shut down when all tests are finished by monitoring the shared `/test` volume, which is managed by docker compose (`external: false`).
- checker.conf contains a list of URLs paired with expected response codes to test:
[source,sh]
----
https://nginx/;200
https://nginx/localhost/;404
https://nginx/50x.html;200
----

== To use
[IMPORTANT]
.Cloning created repositories
====
In order to clone a project repository created by this build script and include the build script submodule files, use the '--recursive' parameter.
[source,sh]
git clone your_project_url.git --recursive
====

[source,sh]
----
build.sh [-lt]

  -b, --build      Build docker image
  -r, --release    Push docker image to registry
  -t, --test       Execute tests

  -l, --local      Run workflow locally in a local docker container
  -v, --verbose    Run in verbose mode
  -f, --force      Force running the build in a fresh environment, requires
                   internet access to pull dependencies. Otherwise internet
                   access is only needed for the first pull of the precompiled
                   build environment image
  -n, --no-export  Don't export the build artiface, this is used when running
                   the build workflow locally

  -h, --help       Show help
----

=== Managing external data

During image building external data (e.g. releases) is often needed. In order to accomodate fetching external data the
copy_data.sh script has been provided. Two methods are defined in this script:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash

init_data (){
    LOCAL=0
    if [ "$1" == "local" ]; then
        LOCAL=1
    fi

    if [ "${LOCAL}" -eq 0 ]; then
        #Remote / gitlab ci
        echo -n ""
    else
        #Local copy
        echo -n ""
    fi
}

cleanup_data () {
    echo -n ""
}
----

As you can see `init_data` supports two scenarios. one for local copy actions and one for gitlab ci integrated copy
actions. This distinction is typically used to download releases (e.g. from b2drop) during gitlab ci workflows and to
copy in local files during local build / development cycles.

`cleanup_data` should implement cleanup commands to remove all files created / downloaded during the `init_data` phase.

An example can be found here: https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-aai-discovery/blob/master/copy_data.sh.

=== Customizing

A number of variables are supported to customize the docker build process. Any of these variables will be passed in to
the docker build command and can be used in the docker file via the `ARG` directive.

[source,sh]
----
 --build-arg VARIABLE=${VARIABLE}"
----

The following variables are supported:

* DIST_VERSION

=== Locally

When building locally the image is build using the environment from https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/build-image as defined
in the build script (```build.sh```).

==== Building

[source,sh]
----
sh build.sh --build --local
----

==== Testing

[source,sh]
----
sh build.sh --test --local
----

==== Releasing

[source,sh]
----
sh build.sh --release --local
----

=== Integrated in GitLab CI

When building remotely (within GitLab CI), the environment specified in the ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file is used.

To integrate GitLab CI add a ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file to your repository with the following content:
[source,sh]
----
#To avoid differences between local and remote builds, this version should be kept in sync with whatever is used from https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/build-image/container_registry
image: docker:17.05.0
services:
  - docker:17.05.0-dind

variables:
    GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release

build:
  artifacts:
    untracked: true
  script: timeout -t 720 sh -x ./build.sh --build
  stage: build
  tags:
    - docker

test:
  artifacts:
    untracked: true
  dependencies:
    - build
  script: timeout -t 720 sh -x ./build.sh --test
  stage: test
  tags:
    - docker

release:
  artifacts:
    untracked: true
  dependencies:
    - test
  only:
    - tags
    - triggers
  script: timeout -t 720 sh -x ./build.sh --release
  stage: release
  tags:
    - docker
----

Note that all scripts are run with a predefined timeout of 720 seconds. If the 
timeout is exceeded the job will typically exit with a `code 143`. If this happens
increase the timeout values as needed.
