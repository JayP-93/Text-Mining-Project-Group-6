data driven features:
lang specific: word, character ngrams
works across langs: pos, dependency ngrams

Domain features:
works across langs: num. words, mean sentence length, type token ratio
lexical density, lexical variation etc (Lu-2010 paper), num.errors, num.spelling errors.

Czech does not have a spell checker I know of. So, error features don't exist for that.

TO ADD: Data driven, language specific:
Character Embeddings
may be: word embeddings?
